      <description>Class: Class time is designed to be as interactive as possible. My role as instructor is to introduce you new tools and techniques, but it is up to you to take them and make use of them. Programming is a skill that is best learned by doing, so as much as possible you will be working on a variety of tasks and activities throughout each class.
Diversity &amp;amp; Inclusiveness: It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students&#39; learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit.</description>

      <description>Introduction Welcome to PHP 1560&amp;frasl;2560. This course is all about how to become a proficient programmer in R. In order to become an R Programmer you must actually practice coding and working in R.
This course is what we call a flipped course. A flipped course is where we have the lecture at home and then in the classroom we focus on hands on learning.
Each week before class you will have a series of Pre-Class work.</description>
