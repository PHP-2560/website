      <description>Overview The goal of your final two projects are to merge everything that you have learned and to create something useful for another researcher or future student to use.
It is very important that we can create tools and present and display material for audiences with diverse backgrounds to engage in. We need to take the code and the skills we have and put them to use for an audience that does not have the same skills.</description>

      <description>It can be difficult to come up with original ideas for apps. You might want to try these things
 Consider a Hobby and how you could create an app around it. Examples:  Health and Fitness Draft Kings  Consider some work your are currently doing in school and create an app around that. Examples  Migration Emulator Associations  Consider an App you might find that would help people with something.</description>

      <description>Introduction Welcome to PHP 1560&amp;frasl;2560. This course is all about how to become a proficient programmer in R. In order to become an R Programmer you must actually practice coding and working in R.
This course is what we call a flipped course. A flipped course is where we have the lecture at home and then in the classroom we focus on hands on learning.
Each week before class you will have a series of Pre-Class work.</description>
