You may need to just use these functions directly:

```
omit.case <- function(the_data,omitted_point) {
  ifelse(dim(as.data.frame(the_data))[2]==1, data.omit<-the_data[-omitted_point], data.omit<-the_data[-omitted_point,])
  return(data.omit)# This should take the data and omit one point at a time and return the new data
  }
```

```

```
omit_and_est <- function(omit) {
  estimator(omit.case(data,omit)) # This function should take the output of omit.case and use it as input for the estimator
}
```
