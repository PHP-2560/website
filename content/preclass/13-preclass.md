## Shiny App Building Pre-Class

### Individual Aspect

1. Go to the [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) website.
    - Explore the [gallery](http://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/) of Project ideas. 
    - Follow the [Tutorial](http://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/)
    - Go through this [Walkthrough by Dean Attali](http://deanattali.com/blog/building-shiny-apps-tutorial/)
    - To show you have done this, create a simple app that takes a standard normal statistic and displays the probability of achieving that value or greater in a standard normal distribution. In other words it takes a \(z\) value and gives a p-value. 
2. Add a folder to your pre-class called Shiny app and plaace the above shiny app in it before class.
