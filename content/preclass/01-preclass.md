## Introduction

Welcome to PHP 1560/2560. This course is all about how to become a proficient programmer in R. In order to become an R Programmer you must actually practice coding and working in R. 

This course is what we call a flipped course. A flipped course is where we have the lecture at home and then in the classroom we focus on hands on learning. 

Each week before class you will have a series of Pre-Class work. This will consists of reading, video/practice courses and some basic programming practice questions. 

Then when you arrive in class, we will work on projects in small groups where you will work together as a team so solve coding/lab challenges. 

## Getting Ready for the First Class

In order to get ready for the first class, we must get certain software set up on our computers as well as installing `git`. We will focus on setting things up in this order:

1. Install R
2. Install RStudio
3. Join DataCamp
3. Install Git


## Installing R

Go to the reading for this week and then install R from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/). 


## Installing RStudio

You must install R first! Then following the instructions in the reading and then go to [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) to download the correct version for your computer. 

## Join DataCamp

Go to [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) then sign in or create an account using your Brown e-mail address. It is important that you use a Brown account as we will be gaining full access to DataCamp for the course. 


Once you have joined DataCamp, the first course you will take will explain the basics of Git. The course is called [Introduction to Git for Data Science](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-git-for-data-science). 



## Come to Class Ready

Bring a fully charged laptop and be ready to work with git and RStudio. Remember participation is 15% of the grade and Pre-class work is 20%. Failure to be prepared will affect both of these.
